# U17 Assignment 2
This project was created for a college assignment on mobile application development. The App was initially to be made on android studio and optimized for mobile devices but was changed to web application that uses local storage. 

## Vocational Scenario 

“Rate This Spot” is a social media app for easily sharing and rating hangout spots. The app should allow the user to use their mobile phone to take a picture of a place they have been at, rate it, write a review, and save it. The prototype of the application should save these reviews locally (to the device). When the user opens the app, they should see a dashboard of all the locations they have saved. The locations should display in a compact format with a shortened description, rating, and a thumbnail image of the location. When the user presses the image, the full review of the location should appear. The applications should have a clear user experience, with a clear way for the user to add a new location and see existing ones. You should also make sure that the application is optimized for mobile devices.

## Review
The application did meet majority of the criteria along with some minor optimization such as the char limit on descriptions. However some features such as the ability to use the camera on the mobile devices wasnt developed or tested - due to the application not yet being run on a mobile device and only desktop. Will try to refine and optimize it to be fully up to the spec requested in later patches.
